# Functional-webpage

This webpage will have basic front and back end functionality. The ability to view the UI, log into an account, store info, and come back to that info after you have signed out and signed back in. (no other user should be able to access your info)

Will begin building the front end. (client side)

Once front end is built, will begin building a node JS backend server. (server side)

Building this out daily :)
